# bqshift

Automate copy of [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) data to [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/).

## Building

```
$ go get github.com/uswitch/bqshift
$ go install github.com/uswitch/bqshift
```

## Running

```
$ export GCLOUD_PROJECT=project-id
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/creds.json
$ bqshift --config=config.example.yml <DEST DATASET> <REDSHIFT TABLE>
```

### Time Partitioned Tables

BigQuery supports [Partitioned Tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables).

> By dividing a large table into smaller partitions, you can improve query performance and reduce the number of bytes billed by restricting the amount of data scanned. BigQuery enables you to partition tables by date.

bqshift can load partitioned data as long as the source data has date information stored, the destination table in BigQuery must also have been declared as time partitioned when it was created. bqshift can automatically create the correct table if it hasn't already been created.

For example, to create a partitioned table from a table that has a `TIMESTAMP` column called `ts`, and to load data into the `2016-09-27` partition you can use the following command:

```
$ bqshift --partition --date-expression="CAST(ts as DATE)" --date=2016-09-27 --config=config.example.yml <DEST DATASET> <REDSHIFT TABLE>
```

#### Overwriting Partitioned Data

It's possible to replace/update an existing partition by adding the `--overwrite` flag. 

```
$ bqshift --overwrite --partition --date-expression="CAST(ts as DATE)" --date=2016-09-27 --config=config.example.yml <DEST DATASET> <REDSHIFT TABLE>
```

Note that you can _only_ update data that was already part of a partition. For example, if you were to create a partitioned table and load a bulk set of historical/archived data when you use `--overwrite` and `--date` you'll overwrite all data in the table. Instead I would suggest having a separate `_archive` table from the partitioned tables.

### Choosing a Different Search Path in AWS Redshift

It's possible to inform a different [search path](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_search_path.html) for the Redshift unload operation.

```
$ bqshift --search-path="enterprise" --config=config.example.yml  <DEST DATASET> <REDSHIFT TABLE>
``` 

## Notes

As part of the unloading process bqshift generates SQL for Redshift; this is _not_ protected against SQL injection attacks so beware of using this tool with user-generated input.

## Releasing

We use [https://github.com/progrium/gh-release](https://github.com/progrium/gh-release) to tag and release artifacts. Install with:

```
$ go get github.com/progrium/gh-release
```

Then to release use:

```
$ VERSION=<...> make gh-release
```
